            <h1>1989</h1>
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.</p>

            <h1>1990</h1>
            <p>By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):</p>

                <p>HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.</p>
                <p>URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.</p>
                <p>HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.</p>

            <h1>1991</h1>
            <p>Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server (“httpd“). By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community.</p>
            <p>As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential would only be unleashed if anyone, anywhere could use it without paying a fee or having to ask for permission.</p>
            <p>He explains: “Had the technology been proprietary, and in my total control, it would probably not have taken off. You can’t propose that something be a universal space and at the same time keep control of it.”</p>
            <p>So, Tim and others advocated to ensure that CERN would agree to make the underlying code available on a royalty-free basis, forever.</p>

            <p>In 2003, the companies developing new web standards committed to a Royalty Free Policy for their work. In 2014, the year we celebrated the web’s 25th birthday, almost two in five people around the world were using it.</p>

            <h1>2030 (My theory)</h1>
            <p>In 2030 I see the Web being more accessible for the world which would bring more people to experiment with the web and the technology. This would bring us a quick boom in adavanced technology and improvements to the web as we know it today.</p>
            <p>As for regular jobs, we could see fade away quick as jobs become more and more digitilized. Already as of today we can see regular jobs being pushed to the digital side like real estate agents, accountants and even cashiers.</p>
            <p>With the regular jobs being faded away, we could look to the youths of the future who will be almost forced to choose studies in the digital area. With more people having to choose studies revolving computers we will see more job opportunity for it. </p>
